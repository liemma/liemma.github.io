            <h3><a href="https://github.com/celinl1220/plt4115_project" target="_blank">Music Notation Compiler</a></h3>
            <p>A programming language designed to simplify music composition through code. It enables users to define melodies, harmonies, and musical structures using an intuitive syntax without requiring formal music theory knowledge. The language supports key signatures, time signatures, note sequences, and transformations like transposition and harmonization, making it a powerful tool for hobbyists, educators, and algorithmic music generation.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="project">
            <h3>Maze Joystick Controlled Game</h3>
            <p>Developed an interactive labyrinth game controlled by an Arduino-powered joystick. Designed and constructed the maze by cutting cardboard walls and securing them onto a plywood base. Integrated two servo motors to tilt the labyrinth in two different planes, enabling dynamic movement based on joystick input.</p>
